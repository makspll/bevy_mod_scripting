# X-Tasks

This crate provides a set of tasks to be used in CI/CD pipelines as well as for local development.

## Developing

When developing it's reccomended to open this in a separate window if using Vscode, as otherwise since this crate is used to compile itself effectively, you will not get IDE feedback.
