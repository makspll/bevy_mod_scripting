# 0.13.0 - new callback, and preserving script state on reloads

## `on_script_reloaded`
Scripts can now subscribe to `on_script_reloaded` and `on_script_unloaded` in order to preserve state between reloads:

```lua
function on_script_unloaded()
    print("Goodbye world")
    return "house key"
end

function on_script_reloaded(value)
    if value then
        print("I'm back. Thanks for the keys!")
    else
end
```

`on_script_unloaded` will be called every time a script is about to be unloaded, giving it the opportunity to return an arbitrary `ScriptValue`, this value will then be passed in to the `on_script_reloaded` 
callback which can be used to re-initialize the script.

`on_script_reloaded` will be called after `on_script_loaded`. 

## Better responses

script callback response events now contain the entity which triggered the response on them.
