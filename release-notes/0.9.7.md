# [`bevy_mod_scripting`](https://github.com/makspll/bevy_mod_scripting/) 0.9.7 is out!

## Summary 
- Adds ability to construct arbitrary types and enums via `construct` global functions:
```lua
local myStruct = construct(StructType, {
    foo = bar
    zoo = construct(NestedType {
        foo = bar
    })
})

local myEnum = construct(EnumType, {
    variant = "StructVariant"
    foo = Bar
})

local myTupleStructEnum = construct(EnumType, {
    variant = "TupleStructVariant"
    _1 = bar
})
``` 

- BMS will now automatically register components with `ReflectComponent` type data, so that you can query them as components *before* inserting them into entities. i.e.:
```rust
#[derive(Reflect, ..)]
#[reflect(Component)]
struct MyComp;
```

- `ReflectAllocator` diagnostics are now available conveniently packaged as a plugin (measuring current allocation count + deallocations):
```rust
app.add_plugins(AllocatorDiagnosticPlugin)
```

- Initial documentation generation from LAD files is now being published with the book over at https://makspll.github.io/bevy_mod_scripting/ladfiles/bindings.lad.html
    - This is still a prototype, but will contain useful information on bindings BMS exports by default.
    - LAD files are in a good shape, but some details need to be polished before they become stable
    - work on other backends (other than mdbook) should be possible now, albeit changes are expected

## Fixes
- When an asset handle is requested and immediately dropped, the previously confusing error: `A script was added but it's asset was not found, failed to compute metadata. This script will not be loaded.` was downgraded to a warning with a helpful hint.
- Cases where resource/component/allocation locks would not be correctly released in the case of script function errors or short-circuting logic were fixed
- The `bevy/reflect_functions` and `bevy/file_watcher` feature flags are no longer pulled into the dependency tree by BMS, reducing bloat.
