# Migrating from 0.16 to 0.17

# `TypedThrough` Changes
> [PR 497](https://github.com/makspll/bevy_mod_scripting/pull/497)

If you were relying on ladfiles or implementing TypedThrough manually, the interfaces will have changed. Some types have moved between crates.

Less types will appear in ladfiles

# Changes to path reflection
> [PR 491](https://github.com/makspll/bevy_mod_scripting/pull/491)

Replace accesses to tuple structs, and tuples containing underscores, i.e. instead of `my_tuple._1` use `my_tuple[1]`

# `ScriptAttachment` Moved to new crate
> [PR 490](https://github.com/makspll/bevy_mod_scripting/pull/490)

A new crate `bevy_mod_scripting_script` was created, to decouple some concerns within the workspace. References will now need to use the `bevy_mod_scripting::script` namespace or a direct crate reference.
