# 0.16.0

# Improved printing and error ergonomics
Printing has been extracted into its own `bevy_mod_scripting_display` crate, and brand new traits including the reflectable `DisplayWithTypeInfo` were written.

There are now Debug and Display equivalent traits which receive type information from semi-static thread local objects in order to print things like `TypeId`'s with full information.

You can now also register `ReflectDisplayWithTypeInfo` against your types in the reflect registry, to customize printing.

# A great re-slicing
Bindings have been split out into individual crates, for example `bevy_reflect` has a corresponding `bevy_reflect_bms_bindings` crate which contain's its bindings. This is possible thanks to a brand new tool which allows us to calculate crate dependencies across a workspace during codegen (see `bevy_mod_scripting_codegen`)

At the same time more bindings are now being generated after fixing some bugs in type discovery.

Other refactorings include `bevy_mod_scripting_bindings`, `bevy_mod_scripting_display` and `bevy_mod_scripting_asset` being pulled out into their own crates.

This has significantly improved compile times allowing us to pack more bindings!

# Getting rid of `HandlerCtxt`
`HandlerCtxt` has been removed and all of its containing resources have been put in `P::readonly_configuration`, which is a semi-static, `WorldId` parameterised static. 

At the same time `ScriptContext<P>` has been wrapped in an `Arc` allowing us to run callbacks within callbacks, as long as they don't modify the same contexts!

# The great bevy minification
BMS has historically pointed at the top level bevy crate, this was handy but fairly clunky as it brought way more dependencies than necessary.

From now on all BMS crates point at bevy subcrates directly, with default features disabled, this means we pull in the minimum amount of dependencies possible (in theory, as long as we didn't miss a feature)

# Brand new scripting pipeline

A shiny new overhauled loading/unloading script pipeline which:
- Is much more customizable (want custom callbacks, or don't like how we named our core callbacks? Just disable them and add your own!)
- More scalable, allowing you to load thousands of scripts, without hogging your framerate (by abstracting loading into tickable state machines)

See the new docs section for details.

# Pre-expanding generated code
Generated code is now expanded at generation time via `cargo expand` saving on compilation time for consumers.
