# Setup

this crate contains a work in progress `xtask` setup which in theory should allow you to setup everything you need for local development by running:

```sh
cargo xtask init
```

This command currently supports the following IDE's

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

If you'd like to add support for another IDE, please feel free to open a PR!
